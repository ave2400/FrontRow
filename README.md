FrontRow website design for the first pilot program. 

**Introduction**

Our innovative note-taking website, FrontRow, transforms how people capture, share, and engage with presentations in classrooms, offices, and conferences. By seamlessly connecting to webcams and phone cameras, our app instantly captures and displays presentation content, eliminating the struggle of keeping up with fast-paced discussions.
We aim to create accessible note-taking for individuals with low vision and learning disabilities. However, with or without a disability FrontRow will be the stop for anyone’s notes and visual information. To enhance clarity, users can apply contrast and cleanup options, ensuring notes remain crisp and readable. What sets us apart is our real-time image integration—whenever a new note is added, corresponding presentation visuals appear instantly.
We redefine accessibility by making presentations more interactive and engaging. Whether in a lecture hall, a business meeting, or a conference, our app ensures that key content is always within reach, helping users focus on ideas rather than scrambling to capture information. Experience the future of note-taking—where innovation meets social impact, FrontRow.
